# US-Life-Expectancy
Data exploration and visualization project. I use datasets from Kaggle and the World Bank to explore why the life expectancy in the US began to drop. 
The main contents can be view in the Project2.ipynb or Project2.pdf file. The remaining files are just the csv files used for the project.
